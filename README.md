This season we will be covering 8-10 papers plus 2-3 sections on software.

Papers should either: (a) introduce novel metholdology that is relevant to the topics of research of interest of the group, or (b) be relevant to the particular applications you are working on. 

Software: we will organize 2-3 sections where we will share what are we developing in terms of software.
